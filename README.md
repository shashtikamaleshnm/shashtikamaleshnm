## Shashti Kamalesh | Software Engineer | Full-Stack Developer

## 3+ years of Building High-Performance, Scalable Applications

I am a full-stack software engineer with a strong track record of delivering innovative and high-quality software solutions. With 3 years of experience working with curring-edge technologies like Java, Spring Boot, React.js and Microservices, I focus on crafting user-centric, scalable systems that make a significant impact.

Whether it's building robust backend APIs, creating seamless front-end experiences, or deploying on cloud infrastructure, I do it all - and I do it with passion and precision. If you're looking for someone who thrives in a fast-paces environment, loves challenges, and is obsessed with writing clean, efficient code, you're in the right place.
